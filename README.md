# MatematikFessorBot
A bot that automated my math homework in middle school

Also accidently botted myself to #1 on national highscores, got pulled pretty fast once though since they figured out that the kid with 100k more correct answers than #2 (at a petty ~2000 correct answers) wasn't actually doing anything lol

Daily reminder to do basic serversided authentification.


# Warning
Code is old as shit and isn't pretty... also C#
